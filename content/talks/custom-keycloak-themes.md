# A real solution to a real problem

* Keycloak theming normally requires raw JS, CSS and FTL (urgh) work.
* Packaging themes is often confusing and not developer‑friendly.
* Login pages should match the look and feel of the main app.
* Recreating designs in Keycloak’s template system is time‑consuming and hard to maintain.
* Keycloakify makes it possible to build these pages as if they were part of your app.

# Using React is optional

* Keycloakify helps you build and preview themes in Storybook or a local Keycloak container.
* React is supported but not required.
* You can style pages with CSS, SCSS, Tailwind, Bootstrap or anything else.

# Easy deployment

* Keycloakify bundles login, account and email themes into one JAR.
* You can upload that file directly to your Keycloak server or just map via Docker volume.
* Works with all Keycloak versions.

# Not just cosmetics

* Supports realtime input validation for login/registration forms.
* Validation rules come from the Keycloak admin console.
* Works automatically with any theme generated by Keycloakify.
